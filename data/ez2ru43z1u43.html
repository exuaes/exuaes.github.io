                <p><strong>1.</strong></p>
                <p>At the end of World War I, Germany was close to collapse. In October 1918, sailors in Kiel refused to fight, and their mutiny started protests across the country. Workers and soldiers formed councils and demanded change. This was the beginning of the November Revolution. On 9 November 1918, SPD leader Friedrich Ebert declared a German Republic. The next day, Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated. Ebert wanted to build a parliamentary democracy, but he faced strong opposition from both sides. On the left, socialist and communist groups such as the USPD and Spartacists wanted a council democracy, where workers and soldiers ruled directly. On the right, the military, civil service, and industry wanted the return of the monarchy. To keep control and prevent a civil war, Ebert made a secret deal with the army. The army promised to support the government, and Ebert promised not to reform it. With their help, the SPD defeated the left-wing uprisings, such as the Spartacist Uprising, in which Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht were killed by the Freikorps. This victory secured the SPD's control but also destroyed trust with the workers. In January 1919, the first free elections were held. The SPD won and created the Weimar Constitution, which introduced a parliamentary democracy. People could vote, and the Reichstag made laws. However, the president had huge power through Article 48, which allowed him to rule by emergency decree without parliament. This meant the system looked democratic, but it wasn't truly so. A president could turn into a dictator legally, without breaking any rules. Because of these weaknesses, extremist parties later used the system to destroy the Weimar Republic itself.</p>

                <h3>4. The author's message</h3>
                <p><strong>* I think this message is only partly convincing,</strong></p>
                <p>The parliamentary democracy was efficient and modern but weak and unstable because too many parties made it difficult to form strong governments. If we assume that real democracy must limit power and protect freedom, then parliamentary democracy was morally bad, because Article 48 allowed one person to become a dictator legally. The council democracy gave real power to workers and soldiers and was more equal, but it was too slow and chaotic for a country in crisis after the war. If we assume that equality and participation are morally good, then council democracy was morally good, because it allowed ordinary people to have a direct voice in politics instead of giving power to elites. The November Revolution ended the monarchy and started democracy, but it failed to bring unity because the SPD, army, and communists fought each other. If we assume that fighting for freedom and ending oppression is morally good, then the November Revolution was morally good, because it removed an unfair monarchy and gave people political rights. Ebert created a parliamentary democracy, but he depended on the old army and Freikorps to stay in power. By using violence against workers and socialists, he weakened trust in democracy. If we assume that a democratic leader should protect the people and their rights, then Ebert was morally bad, because he betrayed the workers, supported the military, and allowed old elites to keep control.</p>
